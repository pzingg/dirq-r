Title: A Filesystem Directory Based Queue
Description: A port of Perl module Directory::Queue::Simple
  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Directory-Queue/
  The goal of this package is to offer a simple queue system
  using the underlying filesystem for storage, security and
  to prevent race conditions via atomic operations. It focuses
  on simplicity, robustness and scalability. This package
  allows multiple concurrent readers and writers to interact
  with the same queue.
